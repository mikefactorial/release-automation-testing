# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main
resources:
  pipelines: # The pipelines specify which pipeline this pipeline will pull artifacts from. In this case we will deploy from the test build's artifacts
    - pipeline: buildPipeline  # pipeline name (DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE) 
      source: deploy-validation-ALMAcceleratorSampleSolution # This is the name of the build pipeline that contains the artifacts to be deployed by this pipeline. NOTE: There must be a successful build for this pipeline available in order to run this pipeline
